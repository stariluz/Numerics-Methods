# Numerics Methods

This is the repository for the webpage where I left all the Numerics Methods that I learned in the Numerics Methods Course for the Computer Science Engineering at UACH.

## Getting Started

The project is developed as an static HTML, CSS and JS Website. It can be locally executing dowloading the repository and opening the file index.html into a web browser.

Since this is an static webpage, I decided to deploy it with GitHub Pages.
